- reading the edf files with edfread proves to be impossible
- while there is rdsamp, using wfdb2mat proves to be the easier approach
- rdann is seriously broken, but fortunately trdedfann (which was meant for edf+ only) proves to yield usable results. unfortunately, it will just pipe everything to stdout, so were gonna have to parse things ourselves
- use the scripts provided to run over all the input files
